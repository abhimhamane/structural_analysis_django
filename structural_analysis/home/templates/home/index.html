            <h2>Beam Analysis</h2>
            Beam Analysis- helps analyse beams using two methods: 
            
            <ol>
                <li>Stiffness Matrix Method </li>  
                <li>Slope Deflection Method</li>
            </ol> 
            <br>
            One can get the outpit of analysis in form of SFD, BMD, Deflection Diagram and Detailed analytical solutions.
            
            Other Analysis methods like Moment Distribution Method and Kanni's Method will be made available in later versions.

            <h2>What If Analysis</h2>
            What If Analysis - Helps develop understanding by tweaking something and comparing SFD and BMD. 
            
            <ol>
                <li>Support Effect - What happens when support conditions are changed?</li> 
                <li>Loading Effect - What happens when loading conditions are changed?</li>
                <li>Compare Mode - Compare two different beams (varying support and loading condition)</li>
            </ol>
